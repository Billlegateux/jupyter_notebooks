But after doing Step 5, need to set password for your account or user in order to use pgAdmin4.

For example, after logging in as you/pybokeh: sudo -u pybokeh psql

Then in the interactive postgres prompt, enter \password pybokeh as depicted below:

pybokeh=# \password pybokeh

It will then prompt you to enter a password twice

Then launch pgAdmin4, create server. In the connection tab, change Host to "localhost", change user to "pybokeh" and enter your password.

That should be it!  Of course if you want to expose your server to the "outside" or beyond localhost/127.0.0.1, you have to make
additional changes or settings.

Useful command line commands:
pg_lsclusters - will output postgres server info and where log file is located at

Step 1) Download and extract the zip installation file for Windows: https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries

Step 2) Then create a “data” folder in your root postgres installation directory.

Step 3) Then create a batch file per this article: https://www.postgresonline.com/journal/index.php?/archives/172-Starting-PostgreSQL-in-windows-without-install.html  Remember to uncomment/un-REM the line with the initdb command when first executing the batch file.  Then afterwards, comment out or REM the initdb line.

Step 4) Then launch pgAdmin4.exe, create new Server, under connection tab, choose “localhost”, enter correct port #, and then click on Save.  To check if everything is working ok in pgAdmin4, select or highlight the postgres database, then right-mouse click and choose “Query Tool...”  A new tab should be created with the connection port icon over on the left should be green.  You should then be able to type SQL statements.

To set password for the default “postgres” user, do the following at command prompt:
psql.exe –U postgres

Then at the postgres=# prompt, enter: \password postgres      You will then be prompted to enter the password twice.

 
To create a new “role” or “user”, do this at the command prompt:
createuser.exe -U postgres –interactive   then follow the prompts

 
Then you need to create a database as the same name as the role/user you just created:
createdb.exe –U postgres <user_name>

 

Now you need to set password for the new role/user you have just created.  Do this at the command prompt:
psql.exe –U <user_name>

Then at the <user_name>=#  prompt, enter: \password <user_name> then you’ll be prompted to enter the password twice

 

That should be it!  To open the database server outside of local host/127.0.0.1, then of course you have to make additionally changes and settings.
